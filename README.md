## Inspiration
Airplane accidents, while statistically rare, often have significant impacts on the aviation industry and society. Our inspiration stemmed from the need to better understand these events—not just as isolated incidents but as part of a larger narrative of safety improvements, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. We wanted to go beyond simple data visualization and create an interactive, emotionally engaging platform that reveals hidden patterns, educates users, and tells compelling stories about aviation safety over time.
## What it does
Our project is a comprehensive Airplane Accident Visualization Dashboard that allows users to explore historical airplane accidents interactively. It features:
**Dynamic Timeline Animation** showcasing accident trends over time.
**Disaster Chain Reaction Analysis** showing how major accidents influenced aviation regulations and safety improvements.
**Cluster Analysis & Heatmaps** highlighting accident hotspots and common causes globally.
**Aircraft Type vs. Accident Rate & Survival Rate** visualizations to compare safety statistics across aircraft models.
**Interactive Risk Calculator** where users can input flight details to assess accident risk probabilities.
**3D Flight Path Accident Reviews** using WebGL/CesiumJS to replay critical moments leading to accidents.
**User Interaction & Voice Integration** for querying insights (e.g., "Which aircraft has the highest survival rate?").
## How we built it
We developed a Python-based pipeline using **Pandas** for data cleaning (1960–2025) and **Geopy** for geocoding. Accident types were clustered with **t-SNE/K-Means**. **Plotly** and **Dash** powered interactive dashboards (heatmaps, scatter plots, animations), while **CesiumJS** enabled 3D flight path views. Advanced features include real-time risk calculations, voice-activated queries, and shareable GIFs. 
## Challenges we ran into
We faced several challenges during development. Data quality was a major issue, with many accident datasets containing missing or inconsistent information, especially regarding locations and causes, which required extensive cleaning, interpolation, and manual verification. Geocoding thousands of accident locations using public APIs like Nominatim led to rate-limiting and timeouts, necessitating retries and caching mechanisms. Performance optimization was also crucial, as handling real-time data updates in Dash for large datasets proved challenging, prompting us to implement downsampling and caching layers. Integrating WebGL/CesiumJS for 3D flight path visualizations was technically demanding, particularly in synchronizing data playback with user interactions. Additionally, designing a user-friendly interface that balanced depth of information with ease of navigation required multiple iterations to perfect the user experience.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully built a dashboard that goes beyond presenting data, offering rich storytelling about aviation safety and how tragic accidents have shaped the industry. Advanced visualizations, including 3D flight path reviews and interactive causal chain reactions, set our project apart by providing deeper insights into accident dynamics. A key technical and UX achievement was the implementation of a real-time risk calculator, allowing users to input actual flight details and receive personalized risk assessments. The platform not only informs but also evokes empathy, fostering a greater awareness of aviation safety and its ongoing importance.
## What we learned
We learned the importance of storytelling in data visualization, making data more engaging by presenting compelling narratives rather than just facts. Optimizing large datasets for real-time interactive dashboards taught us valuable strategies for handling data-heavy applications. Balancing depth and usability was a key challenge, leading to significant growth in UX/UI design. We also expanded our technical skills, deepening our knowledge of WebGL, CesiumJS, and Dash to build advanced interactive features. Finally, working under time pressure enhanced our team collaboration, improving task delegation and communication efficiency.
## What's next for FlySafe
We plan to expand dataset coverage with recent data and variables like weather, flight logs, and pilot experience. The 3D flight replay will feature realistic models, weather overlays, and cockpit data. We aim to optimize the dashboard for mobile, deploy it on the cloud, and integrate machine learning to predict accident risks using real-time inputs. To boost engagement, we’ll add gamification, community insights, and social media sharing. Partnerships with aviation safety organizations will further support training and awareness efforts.
